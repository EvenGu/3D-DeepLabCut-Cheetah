3D Markerless Body Motion Capture for the Cheetah

This repo is a coproduct of the final year (BSc Eng Mechatronics) project conducted by An Chi Chen at the University of Cape Town. 

## Workflow followed for this final year project:

**Camera Calibration:**
   
   Intrinsic: Use [OCamCalib toolbox](https://github.com/urbste/ImprovedOcamCalib) to calibrate the fisheye model camera

   Extrinsic:
   Determine checkerboard/wand points and undistort data using parameters found in the previous step.  
   Using [EasyWand](http://biomech.web.unc.edu/wand-calibration-tools/) determine the extrinsic parameters.  Manually optimise for both wand score and reprojection error.

**2D estimator:**
   Using workflow from [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut) train network for task.
    Analyse desired videos using trained network. 

**3D estimator:**
    Undistort data from 2D estimator.  Determine 3D coordinates using DLT triangulation.

## Useful files in this repo:

**/2D_Evaluation** -> for evaluation of trained networks
  - /Hand_Annotate -> contains hand annotated labeles from 5 different markers
  - determineVariation.py.py -> used to calculate the average distance between same points for different markers, for determining acceptable error range for estimation network

  - /Ground_Truth_Data -> contains Analysis Data set (as described in paper) with correct hand-annotated marker locations
  - /Network_Data -> contains marker locations estimated by the 5 different networks produced from this study for the Analysis Data set
  - NetworkAccuracy.py -> script for determining the accuracy of each network, saves raw distances and determines the average, variance and standard deviation
    
  - plotPoints.py -> used to visaulise marker labels
    
**/3D_Evaluation** -> generating and evaluating 3D estimator
  - /CheetahData -> contains network estimated points for cheetah sequences used for reconstruction
  - dlt_reconstruct.py -> adapted from DLTdv5 by Tyson Hedrick, used to calculate and save the 3D points from the 2D marker locations using DLT coefficients obtained from camera calibration
  - limblength.py -> used to determine the limb lengths (as described in paper), saves individual lengths, and determines the varinace and standard deviation of the lengths
  - plot3D -> uses 3D points obtained from dlt_reconstuct.py to plot 3D cheetah skeleton
    
  - examples of outputs from dlt_reconstruct.py and limblength.py can be found in \CetaneSept23 and \ZorroSept23
